    <h2 class="title">FS Web Developer</h2>
    <p>I am a military wife and mother of 3. Somehow, I have found the time to dive into web development. I thouroughly enjoy being a FS Website Developer and am teaching my kids about it as well. I started  my adulthood thinking that teaching was the career for me. I was not too far off. I love to teach and help others, however, I have found that understanding people and producing what people need is my true gift.</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>As aforementioned, I am a military wife and mother of three beautiful girls. My goal is to be able to write code that will help people and make people happy. I have had my time for procrastination and have definitely learned that it will get me nowhere. I have learned how to prioritize which has given me the life I have today. I want to continue to build myself up for the sake of my daughters. I am strong willed and very determined to succeed. Because of this, I am going to be a great asset to any company who hires me.</p>
